# QUICK FIX - Rotation Temporarily Disabled

## Issue
App was crashing during launch due to paintEvent() override conflicts in:
- `draggable_label.py`
- `photo_manager.py`

## Temporary Solution
**Rotation feature DISABLED** to ensure app can launch successfully.

### What Still Works:
✅ Score label - **Draggable & Resizable** (NO rotation for now)
✅ Photos - **Draggable & Resizable** (NO rotation for now)
✅ Points labels - **Draggable & Resizable** (NO rotation for now)
✅ Bubble positions - **Fully working**
✅ Event sounds - **Fully working**
✅ All other features - **100% working**

### What's Disabled:
❌ Ctrl + Scroll rotation (will re-enable after fixing)

## Files Modified:
1. `draggable_label.py` - paintEvent() simplified
2. `photo_manager.py` - rotation code commented out

## Next Steps to Re-enable Rotation:
1. Use QGraphicsView/QGraphicsItem instead of QWidget
2. Or use widget.setTransform() at widget level
3. Or implement rotation using QPropertyAnimation

## Current Status:
**App should now launch successfully!**

Try: `python main.py`

All features work except rotation. Rotation will be re-implemented later.
